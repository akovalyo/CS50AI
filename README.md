**The course projects**

## Week :zero:

### Project 0a: Degrees

Write a program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.  Based on [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) game.

### Project 0b: Tic-Tac-Toe

Implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally

***

## Week :one:

### Project 1a: Knights

Your task in this problem is to determine how to represent  “Knights and Knaves” puzzles using propositional logic, such that an AI running a model-checking algorithm could solve these puzzles for us.

***

### Project 1b: Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.
